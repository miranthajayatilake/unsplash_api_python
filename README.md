# Unsplash api with python

This code uses the unsplash api to run a search call can download the pictures returned with each search query
along with its tags. You can extend as many search queries as you like, given your unsplash developer account app facilitates it

Before running this code, these steps should be followed:
    - Create an unsplash developer account
    - Create an app (free tier comes with 50 requests per hour)
    - Obtain the Access Key given for the created app

Note: Because of the limited no. of request allowed by unsplash api per hour, this code might run into access denial on a free tier app. To increase the limit you will have to contact unsplash and justify your requirements.

** What this code facilitates
    - Downloading 30 photos from each search query
    - Obtaining user created tags for each photo
    - Creating a dataset with downloaded photos along with a directory of tags
